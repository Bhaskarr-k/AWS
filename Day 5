AWS security groups:
- A security group  controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with.
- For example after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic for the instance.
- when you create a VPC, it comes with a default security group.
- you can create additional security groups for a VPC, each with their own inbound and outbound rules.
- you can specify the source, port and range and protocall for each inbound rule.
security group basics:
- you can assign a security group only to resources created in the same VPC as the security group.
- you can assign multiple security groups to a resource.
- when you create a security group, you mustt provide it with a named and description.
- The following rules apply:
     - A security group name must be unique within the VPC.
     - Names and descriptions can be up to 255 characters in length.
     - Names and descriptions are limited to the following characters:
                          a-z,A-Z,0-9, spaces, and ._-:/()#,@[]+=&;{}!$*.
     - when the name contains trailing spaces, we trim the space at the end of the name, we store it as "Test Security Group".
     - A Security group name cannot start with sg-.
- security groups are stateful.for example, if you send a request from an instance, the response traffic for that request is allowed to reach the instance regardless of the inbound security group rules.
- Responses to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to leave the instance, regardless of the outbound rules.
- security groups do not filter destinated to and from the following.
      - Amazon Domain Name Services (DNS)
      - Amazon Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
      - Amazon EC2 instance metadata
      - Amazon ECS task metadata endpoints
      - License activation for Windows instances
      - Amazon Time Sync Service
      - Reserved IP addresses used by the default VPC router

Security group example:
- The following diagram shows a VPC with two security groups and two subnets.
- The instances in subnet A have the same connectivity requirements, so they are associated with security group 1.
- The instances in subnet B have the same connectivity requirements, so they are associated with security group 2.
- The security group rules allow traffic as follows:
     - The first inbound rule in security group 1 allows SSH traffic to the instances in subnet A from the specified address range (for example, a range in your own network).
     - The second inbound rule in security group 1 allows the instances in subnet A to communicate with each other using any protocol and port.
     - The first inbound rule in security group 2 allows the instances in subnet B to communicate with each other using any protocol and port.
     - The second inbound rule in security group 2 allows the instances in subnet A to communicate with the instances in subnet B using SSH.
     - Both security groups use the default outbound rule, which allows all traffic. 

NACLs:
- Network Access management control levels.

security group:
- Operates at the instance level
- Applies to an instance only if it is associated with the instance
- Supports allow rules only
- Evaluates all rules before deciding whether to allow traffic
- Stateful: Return traffic is allowed, regardless of the rules

Network ACL:
- Operates at the subnet level
- Applies to all instances deployed in the associated subnet (providing an additional layer of definse if security group rules are too permissive)
- Supports allow rules and deny rules
- Evaluates rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, when deciding whether to allow traffic
- Stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by the rules
