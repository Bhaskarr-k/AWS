what is Amazon VPC?
- with Amazon virtual private cloud you can launch AW resources ina logically isolated virtual network that you have defined.
- This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center.
- with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

Features of VPC?

virtual private clouds:
- A VPC is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional network.
- after you have create a VPC, you can add subnets.

subnets:
- A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC.
- A subnet must reside ina single availbility Zone.
- after you add subnets, you can deploy AWS resources in your VPC.

IP addressing:
- you can assign IP addresses, both ipv4 to your VPCS and subnets.
- you can also bring your your public ipv4 addresses and ipv6 GUA addresses to AWS.
- allocate them to resources in your VPC , such as EC2 instances, NAT GATEWAYS, and netwrok load balancers.

Routing:
- use route tables to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

Gateways and endpoints:
- A gateway connects your VPC to another network.

peering connections:
- use a VPC peering connection to route traffic between the resources in the VPCS.

Traffic Mirroring:
- copy network traffic from network interfaces and send it to security and monitoring appliances for deep packet inspection.

Transit gateways:
- use a transit gateway, which acts as a central hub.
- Route traffic betweeen your VPCS, VPN connections, and AWS direct connect connections.

VPC Flow Logs:
- A flow log captures information baout the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

VPN connections:
- connect your VPCS to your on-premises network using AWS virtual private network.

Working with Amazon VPC?
- You can create and manage your VPCs using any of the following interfaces:

AWS Management Console:
-  Provides a web interface that you can use to access your VPCs.

AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI):
- Provides commands for a broad set of AWS services, including Amazon VPC, and is supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

AWS SDKs: 
-  Provides language-specific APIs and takes care of many of the connection details.
- such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling.

Query API:
-  Provides low-level API actions that you call using HTTPS requests. 
-  Using the Query API is the most direct way to access Amazon VPC, but it requires that your application handle low-level details.
-  such as generating the hash to sign the request, and error handling.

pricing for Public IPv4 addresses:
- public IPv4 addresses have the following types

Elastic IP addresses (EIPs):
- Static, public IPv4 addresses provided by Amazon that you can associate with an EC2 instance.
- elastic network interface, or AWS resource.

EC2 public Ipv4 addresses:
- Public IPv4 addresses assigned to an EC2 instance by Amazon.
- if the EC2 instance is launched into a default subnet or if the instance is launched into a subnet that’s been configured to automatically assign a public IPv4 address

BYOIPv4 addresses:
- Public IPv4 addresses in the IPv4 address range that you’ve brought to AWS using Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP).

Service-managed IPv4 addresses:
 - Public IPv4 addresses automatically provisioned on AWS resources and managed by an AWS service.
