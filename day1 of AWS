This helps you be more efficient as you donâ€™t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, 
software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to third-party end-user applications.
